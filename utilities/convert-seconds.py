Convert seconds to human-speak. I modified another example program I had
  written for a training class I took. This was to fulfill a challenge posed to
  me by a co-worker. It may not be the most elegant way to do it, and after I
  finished, I realized there might be a python library to do this. While I
  didn't find one, I did locate this page, which has some other interesting
  solutions.
